AI Algorithm

General strategies to win:
+ Optimize attacks to maximize chances of winning & minimizing risks of attacking creature
+ Reveal as much as you can about their opponent (their hand & field)
+ Keep your cards hidden (aka reducing risk)
+ Reduce field creature risk
+ Sabotage opponent (take valuable cards to disrupt their strategies [e.g. taking away the other half of a matching creature card])

Attacking:
+ Analyze ALL attack combinations
 - Determine probability that the attacking creature will win against attacked creature
 - Determine probability that the attacking creature will lose
 - Estimate how valuable attacking creature is
 - Estimate how valuable attacked creature
 - Use these metrics to generate an attack likelihood score for this combination
+ Determine if any attack likelihood scores are high enough to merit an attack
 - If yes, determine the combination with the highest likelihood score and perform attack

Reinforce turn:
+ Analyze personal field cards 
 - Determine risk of card based on:
  ~ the assessment of creatures on opponent field (i.e. how likely can the opponent get rid of your creature?)
  ~ how well protected the card is (is it revealed? What upgrades are on the card? Are they also revealed?)
 - Determine value of card based on:
  ~ Is it needed to make a double creature? Is it even possible to make it a double creature?
  ~ Is it the only card of a certain type?
+ Assess hand
 - Analyze each card and determine a usefulness score
  ~ Analysis will need to be unique for each card since each card has pretty different capabilities
  ~ Analysis should focus on how to strengthen cards on field, through increasing attack combinations likelihoods (action cards will need more help in predicting how it will impact the attack likelihoods)
  ~ Special attention should be given to valuable field cards that are at high risk and how hand cards can reduce this risk
+ Play the card that has the highest usefulness score
+ Repeat again for placing second card
