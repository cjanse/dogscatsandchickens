AI Algorithm

General strategies to win:
+ Optimize attacks to maximize chances of winning & minimizing risks of attacking creature
+ Reveal as much as you can about their opponent (their hand & field)
+ Keep your cards hidden (aka reducing risk)
+ Reduce field creature risk
+ Sabotage opponent (take valuable cards to disrupt their strategies [e.g. taking away the other half of a matching creature card])

Attacking:
+ Analyze ALL attack combinations
 - Determine probability that the attacking creature will win against attacked creature
 - Determine probability that the attacking creature will lose
 - Estimate how valuable attacking creature is
 - Estimate how valuable attacked creature
 - Use these metrics to generate an attack likelihood score for this combination
+ Determine if any attack likelihood scores are high enough to merit an attack
 - If yes, determine the combination with the highest likelihood score and perform attack

Reinforce turn:
+ Analyze personal field cards 
 - Determine risk of card based on:
  ~ the assessment of creatures on opponent field (i.e. how likely can the opponent get rid of your creature?)
  ~ how well protected the card is (is it revealed? What upgrades are on the card? Are they also revealed?)
 - Determine value of card based on:
  ~ Is it needed to make a double creature? Is it even possible to make it a double creature?
  ~ Is it the only card of a certain type?
+ Assess hand
 - Analyze each card and determine a usefulness score
  ~ Analysis will need to be unique for each card since each card has pretty different capabilities
  ~ Analysis should focus on how to strengthen cards on field, through increasing attack combinations likelihoods (action cards will need more help in predicting how it will impact the attack likelihoods)
  ~ Special attention should be given to valuable field cards that are at high risk and how hand cards can reduce this risk
+ Play the card that has the highest usefulness score
+ Repeat again for placing second card


Analyzing Creature Cards in Hand:
+ General Factors to consider:
 - Amount of creatures on opponent field (0.1)
  ~ min(amount of opponent field creatures * 0.2,1)
 - Known opponent creature cards vs. creatures already on the field (0.5)
  ~ if hand creature can defeat opposing creature & can't be defeated by any opposing creature & field creature can be defeated by opposing creature that hand creature can defeat & there is no field creature of the same type as hand creature: 1
  ~ else if creature can defeat opposing creature & can't be defeated by any opposing creature & there is no field creature of the same type as hand creature: 0.8
  ~ else if creature can defeat opposing creature & there is no field creature of the same type as hand creature & field creature can be defeated by opposing creature that hand creature can defeat: 0.5
  ~ else if creature can defeat opposing creature & field creature can be defeated by opposing creature that hand creature can defeat & can't be defeated by any opposing creature: 0.3
  ~ else if creature can defeat opposing creature & field creature can be defeated by opposing creature that hand creature can defeat: 0.15
  ~ All other cases: 0
 - probability of specific creature types vs. creatures already on the field (0.2)
  ~ Count known creature cards of each type in opponent hand, your hand, your field, and discord h
   + if all counts are 0: 0
  ~ if exposed type on board & no same creature type: min((1 - count of type that creature) / (1 - count of all types) x 1.5,1) 
  ~ if exposed type on board: min((1 - count of type that creature) / (1 - count of all types) x 1.25,1)
  ~ if no same creature type: min((1 - count of type that creature) / (1 - count of all types) x 1.15,1)
  ~ All other cases: (1 - count of type that creature) / (1 - count of all types)
 - Ability to make a double creature (now or in the future) (0.2)
  ~ if matching card is on field or in hand: 1
  ~ if matching card is not in player field or discard pile: 0.25
  ~ All other cases: 0
